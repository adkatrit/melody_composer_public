currently in the process of moving the code from my private repo to this public repo so people can use the melody composer and give feedback.

this is a genetic algorithm that composes melodies. it builds a markov model to spawn the initial population to a) slightly reduce the search space,
and b) act as an influencer. the user has the ability to select <i>x</i> differnt artists, <i>y</i> different songs, and/or <i>z</i> different genres.
this web-app uses web.py as the framework, jquery for the interactive fitness function, and sqlite3 as the database. this is only a prototype right now, so my 
primary concern for the time being is to have this application compose melodies that are based on the user's taste. 

if you have any questions and/or comments please feel free to contact me.
